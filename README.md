# Node with React: Fullstack Web Development, with suggested improvement

Code from the
[Node with React: Fullstack Web Development course by Stephen Grider](https://www.udemy.com/node-with-react-fullstack-web-development/learn/v4/content)

## Differences from Stephen's progress

See README at [My original repository](https://github.com/JulianNicholls/Node-with-React)

## Suggested improvements

I'm going to implement some or all of the improvements suggested by Stephen in Lecture 195.

### Replace Materialize with Bootstrap

Change to use Bootstrap. This is not one of his suggestions, but I just prefer it.

### Allow the user to save a survey for later

* Have options to save, save and send, edit and send / send again

### Survey Cards

* Colour the yes and no
* Add something like a chart for yes and no.
* Add the last responded date.
* Sort by number of votes, date sent, last responded date, and sent / unsent

### Allow for deleting surveys

This is arguably pointless at the moment because all surveys have been sent
out already. It becomes more important when it is possible to create a survey
for later sending that you then decide not to send.

### Allow the user to specify the from field
